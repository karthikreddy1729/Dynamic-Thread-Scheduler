# Dynamic-Thread-Scheduler
- Created multi-threaded thread scheduler by implementing thread structure, and thread stack dynamically in C
- Implemented thread scheduling by creating a Circular Linked List to schedule threads in Round Robin fashion
- Achieved concurrent non parallel execution by context switching between threads using setjmp() and longjmp() kernel system calls
